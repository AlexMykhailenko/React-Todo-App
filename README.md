Installation
We use node 5.x and npm 3.x, so you may need to download a new version of node. The easiest way is to download nvm. We have a .nvmrc file in the root of the project, so you can just run nvm use to switch to the correct version of node.

Install dependencies by running the following in the root of the project:

npm i
Note: You must use npm 3. Type npm -v to ensure you have a 3.x version.
NPM Commands
To run locally, run npm run dev and head to localhost:8080
To run the test runner: npm test
To make sure your code passes linting: npm run lint
To create the build: npm run build
